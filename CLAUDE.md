# Cupping Training App

Coffee cupping/triangulation training app with multiplayer rooms.

## Tech Stack
- **Monorepo**: Turborepo with npm workspaces
- **Web**: Next.js 16 (App Router, React 19), Tailwind CSS 4, shadcn/ui (Radix)
- **Mobile**: Expo SDK 52, Expo Router 4, React Native 0.76
- **Auth**: Clerk (`@clerk/nextjs` for web, `@clerk/clerk-expo` for mobile)
- **Database**: Supabase (Postgres + Realtime)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Deployment**: Vercel (web)

## Architecture

### Auth: Clerk + Supabase Native Integration
- Clerk is the auth provider. Supabase uses Clerk as a **third-party auth provider** (not JWT templates).
- Client-side: `useSupabaseClient()` hook in `apps/web/lib/supabase/client.ts` creates a Supabase client with `accessToken: () => session.getToken()` (no template param).
- Server-side (with RLS): `createServerSupabaseClient()` in `apps/web/lib/supabase/server.ts` uses `accessToken: () => auth().getToken()`.
- Server-side (admin/bypass RLS): `createAdminSupabaseClient()` in `apps/web/lib/supabase/admin.ts` uses `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`. All server actions use this.
- **Never** use `session.getToken({ template: 'supabase' })` — that's the deprecated JWT template approach.

### Realtime: Broadcast Channels (not postgres_changes)
- Supabase `postgres_changes` requires RLS-authenticated sessions which don't work reliably with Clerk's third-party auth.
- All realtime features use **Broadcast** channels instead — pure pub/sub, no RLS dependency.
- Channel names and event constants live in `@cuppingtraining/shared/constants` (`packages/shared/src/constants/broadcast.ts`).
- Room sync channel: `getRoomSyncChannel(roomId)` with `{ self: true }` — handles all game events.
- Invitation notifications: `getUserInvitationsChannel(clerkId)` — host broadcasts `INVITATION_EVENTS.NEW_INVITATION` when inviting.

### Broadcast Events
- Constants are defined in `packages/shared/src/constants/broadcast.ts`.
- Cup Tasters events use `CUP_TASTERS_EVENTS.*`, Cupping events use `CUPPING_EVENTS.*`, Invitation events use `INVITATION_EVENTS.*`.

| Constant | Event String | Payload | Description |
|----------|-------------|---------|-------------|
| `CUP_TASTERS_EVENTS.GAME_START` | `game_start` | `{ startedAt }` | Host starts countdown, all players sync |
| `CUP_TASTERS_EVENTS.GAME_PLAYING` | `game_playing` | `{ timerStartedAt }` | Countdown done, timer begins with exact timestamp |
| `CUP_TASTERS_EVENTS.GAME_PAUSE` | `game_pause` | `{}` | Host paused the game |
| `CUP_TASTERS_EVENTS.GAME_RESUME` | `game_resume` | `{ newTimerStartedAt }` | Host resumed, timer_started_at shifted forward |
| `CUP_TASTERS_EVENTS.PLAYER_FINISHED` | `player_finished` | `{ userId, username, elapsedMs }` | A player clicked Finish |
| `CUP_TASTERS_EVENTS.ROUND_ENDED` | `round_ended` | `{}` | Host ended the round, all players return to lobby |
| `CUP_TASTERS_EVENTS.SESSION_ENDED` | `session_ended` | `{ sessionId }` | Host ended the session |
| `CUP_TASTERS_EVENTS.ROOM_UPDATED` | `room_updated` | `{}` | Generic refresh trigger (invites, coffees, sets) |
| `CUPPING_EVENTS.CUPPING_STARTED` | `cupping_started` | `{ coffeeCount }` | Host started cupping session |
| `CUPPING_EVENTS.PLAYER_SUBMITTED` | `player_submitted` | `{ userId, username }` | A player submitted scores |
| `CUPPING_EVENTS.CUPPING_ENDED` | `cupping_ended` | `{ sessionId }` | Host ended cupping session |
| `CUPPING_EVENTS.ROOM_UPDATED` | `room_updated` | `{}` | Generic refresh trigger |
| `INVITATION_EVENTS.NEW_INVITATION` | `new_invitation` | `{}` | Notifies invited user |

### Multiplayer Game Sync
- **Countdown sync**: Host broadcasts `CUP_TASTERS_EVENTS.GAME_START` with `{ startedAt: Date.now() }`. Non-host calculates elapsed time and starts countdown from the synced number.
- **Timer sync**: Host calls `beginPlaying()` server action which returns `timerStartedAt`. Host broadcasts `CUP_TASTERS_EVENTS.GAME_PLAYING` with this exact timestamp. Non-host receives it and passes to Timer component. No DB polling — eliminates race condition.
- **Pause/Resume**: Host-only. `pauseGame()` records `paused_at`, `resumeGame()` shifts `timer_started_at` forward by pause duration. All via broadcast.
- **Waiting states**: Non-host players see a "Starting..." screen between countdown end and `game_playing` broadcast arrival, so the timer doesn't mount with null `startTime`.

### Multi-Round Game Flow
```
Lobby (waiting) → Select Set → Start Round → Countdown → Playing → Finish → Check Answers → End Round → Lobby
```
- Room status cycle: `waiting` → `countdown` → `playing` ↔ `paused` → `waiting` (repeat)
- **Coffees persist** between rounds and are editable in the lobby.
- **Sets persist** between rounds. Host can add/delete sets and select which one to play.
- `active_set_id` on rooms tracks which set is being played in the current round.
- **Finish button**: Any player can click Finish to record their elapsed time (saved to `round_results` table). Broadcast notifies all players.
- **End Round**: Host clicks "End Round" after checking answers → `endRound()` resets room to `waiting` → broadcasts `round_ended` → all players return to lobby.
- Non-host players see "Waiting for host to start next round..." after checking their answers.

### Cupping Forms
- Two cupping form types: **Simple** (`'simple'`) and **SCA** (`'sca'`), controlled by `CuppingFormType` union.
- **Simple Form**: Web (`apps/web/components/cupping/simple-form.tsx`), Mobile (`apps/mobile/components/cupping/SimpleForm.tsx`). 5 attributes (Aroma, Acidity, Sweetness, Body, Aftertaste) each rated 1-5 stars with notes, plus overall notes. Total score is the average (1.0-5.0).
- **SCA Form**: Web (`apps/web/components/cupping/sca-form.tsx`), Mobile (`apps/mobile/components/cupping/ScaForm.tsx`). Standard SCA protocol with 11 attributes and 100-point scale. Mobile uses stepper buttons instead of range sliders.
- Utilities: `@cuppingtraining/shared/cupping` (`getDefaultSimpleScores`, `calculateSimpleTotalScore`, `getDefaultScaScores`, `calculateScaTotalScore`).
- Solo flow: user selects form type in setup phase (default: Simple). Scores use `ScaCuppingScores | SimpleCuppingScores` union. Available on both web and mobile.
- Room flow: host selects form type in lobby. Stored in `rooms.settings` as `{ form_type: 'simple' | 'sca' }`. All players use the same form.
- Results/session detail views check `score.form_type` to render the correct form component.

### Flavor Words & Autocomplete
- `user_flavor_words` table stores per-user custom vocabulary (word + user_id, unique constraint).
- **Common words**: `COMMON_FLAVOR_WORDS` from `@cuppingtraining/shared/flavor-words` — SCA Flavor Wheel descriptors organized by `FLAVOR_CATEGORIES`.
- **Autocomplete**: `AutocompleteNotesInput` component (web + mobile) provides suggestions from common + custom words while typing in notes fields. Comma-separated input, suggestions appear after 1+ chars.
- **FlavorWordsProvider**: Context provider wrapping cupping layouts. Exposes `{ words: string[], addWord: (word) => Promise<void> }`. Web uses `getUserFlavorWords()` / `addFlavorWord()` server actions. Mobile uses `/api/mobile/flavor-words` GET/POST.
- **Post-Session Review**: `NewWordsReview` component (web + mobile) shown in results views. Uses `extractNewWordsFromSamples()` to find words not in common/custom lists. Users select words via pills and bulk-save to vocabulary.
- **No inline save during cupping** — autocomplete only suggests existing words. New word saving happens exclusively in post-session review.
- Utilities: `@cuppingtraining/shared/flavor-words` (`extractWordsFromScores`, `extractNewWords`, `extractNewWordsFromSamples`).
- Server actions: `apps/web/actions/flavor-words.ts` (`getUserFlavorWords`, `addFlavorWord`, `removeFlavorWord`).
- Mobile API: `apps/web/app/api/mobile/flavor-words/route.ts` (GET list, POST add word).
- Settings page (`/settings`) lets users manage their vocabulary (add/remove words).

### Session Report
- `SessionReportCard` component (`apps/web/components/cupping/session-report-card.tsx`) — shown in multiplayer results view and session detail page.
- Uses `generateSessionReport()` from `@cuppingtraining/shared/cupping` to compute all data.
- 4 sections: **Session Summary** (stat cards), **Score Comparison** (per-coffee avg/high/low + player score pills), **Attribute Averages** (progress bars), **Community Notes** (word frequency pills + per-player notes).
- Utility: `packages/shared/src/cupping/session-report.ts` — exports `generateSessionReport()` and types (`SessionReport`, `CoffeeSummary`, `CoffeeNotes`, `AttributeAverage`, etc.).

### Mobile API Layer
- Mobile app communicates with the web app's Next.js API routes (not server actions directly).
- API routes live in `apps/web/app/api/mobile/` and wrap existing server action logic.
- Auth: mobile sends Clerk JWT as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.
- `apps/web/lib/api/auth.ts` — `getAuthenticatedProfile(request)` verifies token via `@clerk/backend`'s `verifyToken()`, resolves Clerk ID → `user_profiles.id` UUID.
- `useApiClient()` hook in `apps/mobile/lib/api.ts` — auto-attaches Clerk Bearer token, base URL from `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` env var.

### Mobile API Routes
| Route | Method | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/mobile/profile` | GET | Returns user profile (username, bio, photo_url, onboarding status) |
| `/api/mobile/profile/update-username` | POST | JSON `{ username }` — updates username (uniqueness check) |
| `/api/mobile/onboarding/check-username` | GET | `?username=xyz` — checks username availability |
| `/api/mobile/onboarding/upload-photo` | POST | Multipart form data — uploads photo to Supabase storage |
| `/api/mobile/onboarding/complete` | POST | JSON `{ username, bio, photoUrl }` — completes onboarding |
| `/api/mobile/dashboard/cup-tasters` | GET | Returns `PlayerDashboardData` (stats, accuracy trend, coffee stats, session history) |
| `/api/mobile/dashboard/cupping` | GET | Returns `CuppingDashboardData` (stats, session history) |
| `/api/mobile/flavor-words` | GET | Returns user's custom flavor words |
| `/api/mobile/flavor-words` | POST | JSON `{ word }` — adds word to user's vocabulary |

## Database Schema (key tables)
- `user_profiles` — id (UUID PK), clerk_id (TEXT, Clerk user ID for auth lookup), username, bio, photo_url
- `rooms` — host_id (UUID FK → user_profiles.id), code, status, settings (JSONB, includes form_type), timer_minutes, timer_started_at, paused_at, active_set_id
- `room_players` — room_id, user_id (UUID FK → user_profiles.id)
- `room_coffees` — room_id, label (A/B/C...), name
- `room_sets` — room_id, set_number
- `room_set_rows` — set_id, row_number, pair_coffee_id, odd_coffee_id, odd_position
- `round_results` — room_id, user_id (UUID FK → user_profiles.id), timer_started_at (round key), finished_at, elapsed_ms
- `room_invitations` — room_id, invited_user_id (UUID FK → user_profiles.id), invited_by (UUID FK → user_profiles.id), status
- `cupping_sessions` — user_id, room_id
- `cupping_samples` — session_id, sample_number, sample_label
- `cupping_scores` — sample_id, user_id, form_type ('sca' | 'simple'), scores (JSONB), total_score
- `user_flavor_words` — user_id (UUID FK → user_profiles.id), word (TEXT), unique on (user_id, word)
- **Note**: All user references are UUID FKs to `user_profiles.id`. Clerk IDs are only stored in `user_profiles.clerk_id`.

## Shared Package (`@cuppingtraining/shared`)
- **No build step** — consumers (Next.js, Expo) transpile raw TypeScript directly.
- Import paths: `@cuppingtraining/shared/types`, `@cuppingtraining/shared/cupping`, `@cuppingtraining/shared/constants`, `@cuppingtraining/shared/flavor-words`.
- Web app includes `transpilePackages: ['@cuppingtraining/shared']` in `apps/web/next.config.ts`.
- Mobile app resolves via `paths` in `tsconfig.json` + Metro `watchFolders` in `metro.config.js`.
- Types, cupping utils, flavor word utils, and broadcast constants are the single source of truth shared across apps.

## Key Server Actions (`apps/web/actions/rooms.ts`)
- `createRoom`, `deleteRoom`, `joinRoomByCode` — room lifecycle
- `inviteUserByUsername`, `respondToInvitation`, `cancelInvitation` — invitations
- `addCoffee`, `removeCoffee` — coffee management (waiting status only)
- `generateTriangulationSet`, `createEmptySet`, `updateSetRow`, `deleteSet` — set management
- `startGame(roomId, setId)` — initiates countdown with selected set
- `beginPlaying` — transitions to playing, returns `timerStartedAt`
- `pauseGame`, `resumeGame` — host-only pause/resume
- `finishRound` — any player records finish time (pause-aware elapsed calculation)
- `endRound` — host resets room to waiting for next round

## Key Server Actions (`apps/web/actions/cupping.ts`)
- `createCuppingRoom` — creates a cupping room with `type: 'cupping'` and `settings: { form_type }`
- `updateCuppingFormType` — host changes form type in lobby (waiting status only)
- `getCuppingRoomDetails` — returns room with players, invitations, coffees, and `currentUserProfileId`
- `startCuppingSession` — host starts session, creates `cupping_sessions` + `cupping_samples` rows
- `submitCuppingScores` — any player submits scores (accepts `ScaCuppingScores | SimpleCuppingScores`)
- `endCuppingSession` — host ends session, resets room to waiting
- `getCuppingResults` — returns session results with coffee names revealed
- `getCuppingDashboard`, `getCuppingSessionDetail` — dashboard and history views

## Key Conventions
- `apps/web/proxy.ts` is the Next.js 16 replacement for `middleware.ts`. Uses `clerkMiddleware()`. `/api/mobile(.*)` is in the public routes list — mobile API routes handle their own auth via Bearer tokens.
- Server actions in `apps/web/actions/` use `createAdminSupabaseClient()` (service role) to bypass RLS.
- Server actions use `getProfileId()` helper to resolve Clerk auth to `user_profiles.id` UUID. All DB operations use UUID profile IDs, not Clerk IDs.
- `inviteUserByUsername` returns `{ invitation, invitedClerkId }` — the Clerk ID is needed for broadcast channel naming (`getUserInvitationsChannel(clerkId)`).
- `getRoomDetails` returns `{ room, currentUserProfileId }` — the client uses `currentUserProfileId` for `isHost` checks and `player_finished` broadcasts.
- RLS helper function `auth_profile_id()` resolves `auth.jwt()->>'sub'` (Clerk ID) to `user_profiles.id` UUID. Used by `is_room_member()`, `is_room_host()`, and all RLS policies.
- Web client components use `useSupabaseClient()` hook for Supabase access.
- Timer component accepts `hideControls` and `isPaused` props for multiplayer mode.
- Host is source of truth for all game state transitions (start, pause, resume, end round).
- All players sync via Broadcast — no DB polling during gameplay.
- All shared types, cupping utils, and broadcast constants are imported from `@cuppingtraining/shared/*` — never use local `@/types/database` or `@/lib/cupping/`.
- Mobile API routes in `apps/web/app/api/mobile/` use `getAuthenticatedProfile()` from `apps/web/lib/api/auth.ts` — verifies Bearer token via `@clerk/backend`'s `verifyToken()`.
- Mobile app uses `useApiClient()` hook — all API calls go through `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL/api/mobile/*`.
- Mobile styling uses React Native `StyleSheet` with color constants from `apps/mobile/lib/colors.ts` — no UI library.
- Mobile navigation uses Expo Router `(tabs)` group with 5 bottom tabs: Home, Cup Tasters, Cupping, Dashboard, Profile.
- Solo flows (Cup Tasters + Cupping) are entirely client-side on mobile — no API calls needed during gameplay.
- Mobile root `index.tsx` checks profile via API on launch — shows "Could not connect to server" with Retry on network failure instead of false-redirecting to onboarding.
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` should be `http://localhost:3000` for iOS simulator, or the Mac's local IP (e.g. `http://172.20.10.2:3000`) for physical devices.

## Commands
- `npm run dev` — start all apps via Turborepo
- `npm run dev:web` — start only the web app
- `cd apps/mobile && npx expo start --clear` — start mobile app (Expo dev server)
- `npm run build` — production build (all packages)
- `npm run lint` — run ESLint (all packages)

## Mobile App Development Phases
- **Phase 1** (done): Onboarding, bottom tab navigation, Solo Cup Tasters, Solo Cupping, Profile (with username editing)
- **Phase 2** (done): Dashboard with stats, accuracy trend, coffee performance, session history (Cup Tasters + Cupping tabs)
- **Phase 3** (future): Multiplayer rooms with real-time Broadcast sync (requires ~25 API routes)
